Flake8 - Octo-Ninja Linter
==========================

.. admonition:: Main point
   :class: tip

   Flake8 combines so much linter-power under the hood of a single tool! If used correctly, it will make your code not only more consistent, but simply better (and more pythonic üêç).


+ `Flake8 <https://github.com/PyCQA/flake8>`_ is a wrapper around three tools:

    1. `PyFlakes <https://github.com/PyCQA/pyflakes>`_ - checks for Python errors.

    2. `pycodestyle <https://github.com/PyCQA/pycodestyle>`_ - tests Python code against some of the style conventions in `PEP 8 <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/>`_.

    3. `McCabe <https://github.com/PyCQA/mccabe>`_ - analyses Python code complexity (see the :ref:`next section <python_mccabe>` for more details).

+ Flake8 is configurable, where specific setup can be pointed in a `couple of ways <http://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/user/configuration.html>`_.

    + You may find preconfigured `.flake8 <https://github.com/RTBHOUSE/big-bang-py/blob/master/%7B%7Bcookiecutter.project_dir%7D%7D/.flake8>`_ in Big-Bang-py.

+ There is an abundance of `plugins <http://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/user/using-plugins.html>`_ greatly extending capability of Flake8. Search for them on `GitHub <https://github.com/search?q=flake8>`_.

    + A bunch of plugins are included in Flake8 configuration of Big-Bang-py. See all `flake8-*` packages in `Pipfile <https://github.com/RTBHOUSE/big-bang-py/blob/master/%7B%7Bcookiecutter.project_dir%7D%7D/Pipfile#L12-L17>`_.

    + An interesting example is `flake8-html <https://github.com/lordmauve/flake8-html>`_, which generates readable Flake8 HTML report (works similar to `coverage html`).

+ It is recommended to include Flake8 in your linting Invoke task and also to run it during pre-commit Git hook. Example of both can be found in Big-Bang-py, see `tasks.py <https://github.com/RTBHOUSE/big-bang-py/blob/master/%7B%7Bcookiecutter.project_dir%7D%7D/tasks.py#L54-L58>`_ and `pre-commit <https://github.com/RTBHOUSE/big-bang-py/blob/master/%7B%7Bcookiecutter.project_dir%7D%7D/hooks/pre-commit#L61-L77>`_.

+ To manage edge cases exclude Flake8 checking:

    + `per line <http://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/user/violations.html#in-line-ignoring-errors>`_ e.g. ``example = lambda: 'example'  # noqa: E731,E123``;

    + `for entire file <http://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/user/violations.html#ignoring-entire-files>`_;

     Usually the best idea is to put exclusions in Flake8 config, for instance:

    .. code-block:: ini

        exclude =
            # No need to traverse our git directory
            .git,
            # There's no value in checking cache directories
            __pycache__,
            # The conf file is mostly autogenerated, ignore it
            docs/source/conf.py,

    + `for particular errors in the entire project <http://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/user/configuration.html#project-configuration>`_, see an example in `Here-Be-Pythons! <https://github.com/RTBHOUSE/big-bang-py/blob/master/%7B%7Bcookiecutter.project_dir%7D%7D/.flake8#L2-L41>`_
