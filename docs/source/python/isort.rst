isort - Imports Sorter
======================

.. admonition:: Main point
   :class: tip

   Use `isort <https://github.com/timothycrosley/isort>`_ to automatically sort and group Python imports.


+ There are several knobs configuring isort's behavior. Full reference of settings can be found on `the isort wiki <https://github.com/timothycrosley/isort/wiki/isort-Settings#full-reference-of-isort-settings>`_.

+ You can specify project level configuration by placing ``.isort.cfg`` file at the root of your project.

    + An example of preconfigured ``.isort.cfg`` is in `Big-Bang-py <https://github.com/CapedHero/big-bang-py/blob/master/%7B%7Bcookiecutter.project_dir%7D%7D/.isort.cfg>`_.

+ It is recommended to include isort in your linting Invoke task and also to run it during Pre-commit Git Hook. Example of both can be found in Big-Bang-py, see `project.py <https://github.com/CapedHero/big-bang-py/blob/master/%7B%7Bcookiecutter.project_dir%7D%7D/tasks/project.py#L34-L35>`_ and `pre-commit <https://github.com/CapedHero/big-bang-py/blob/master/%7B%7Bcookiecutter.project_dir%7D%7D/githooks/pre-commit#L36-L45>`_ files.

+ To manage edge cases, `disable isort <https://github.com/timothycrosley/isort#skip-processing-of-imports-outside-of-configuration>`_:

    + per line:

    .. code-block:: python

        from spam import gouda, eggs  # isort:skip

        # OR

        from foo import (  # isort:skip
            baz,
            bar,
        )

    + per file:

    .. code-block:: python

        """
        Make the best, yet wrongly sorted, spam & eggs.

        NOTE!
        To make isort skip an entire file simply, add `isort:skip_file` somewhere
        in module's docstring, just like below:

        isort:skip_file
        """

        import spam
        import eggs
