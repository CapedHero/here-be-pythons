README - Gateway to Your Code
=============================

.. admonition:: Main point
   :class: tip

   Make a README, because no one can read your mind (`at least not yet <https://www.makeareadme.com/#mind-reading>`_ ðŸ˜€).

    Is it your favorite book? ;)

+ Documentation forces you to prove that you understand how your program works and that you can explain it to the world. Moreover, such journey usually results in finding most surprising bugs. Documentation becomes your rubber duck!

+ By bringing the most essential knowledge about the project in a structured manner, README serves as a lantern for all of the programmers from the future - including the future YOU!

    + To expand a bit, we should be honest and accept that over time code becomes more and more alien. `Legacy code is anything weâ€™re not writing right now <https://itnext.io/it-doesnt-have-to-be-perfect-25071b56959b>`_.

      Without a solid startup documentation it will be super easy to get lost with a very grim perspective to get found. We have all been there, so we should do our best to save the pain for the programmers to come.

+ There is no obvious consensus regarding what README should contain. However, it seems that a good one should answer **at least** to the questions below (provided they are applicable):

    + Project:

        + What is it about?

        + Why is it needed?

        + How does it solve the problem?

    + Application/Library:

        + How to install, test and build it?

        + How to use it?

    + How to contribute and deploy?

+ If you want to get inspired, `Make a README <https://www.makeareadme.com/>`_ and `Awesome README <https://github.com/matiassingers/awesome-readme#articles>`_ are fantastic sites to dig.

+ The recommended format of README is `Markdown <https://commonmark.org/help/>`_. This lightweight markup language is simple, powerful and popular, making it a perfect choice for most of the projects.

    + A popular alternative is `reStructuredText <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ReStructuredText>`_. However, it is far more advanced than Markdown, which for README might be an overkill.
